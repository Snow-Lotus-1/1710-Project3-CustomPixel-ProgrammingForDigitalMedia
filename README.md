# 1710-Project3-CustomPixel-ProgrammingForDigitalMedia

Instruction:
Reach the green patch of the opposite corner of the map
Must reach the end of the patch, either 0y or 1000y to register as map completion
Green patch is just there to give a general idea of where the goal is at all times to the player
There are 3 maps to clear
use the mouse as a flashlight to guide the "player" through the maze
